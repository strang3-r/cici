| **Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala** | 1973 | Doctrine of Basic Structure: Parliament can amend the Constitution, but not alter its basic structure. This includes principles like fundamental rights, parliamentary democracy, secularism, federalism, separation of powers, and judicial review.                                                                                                                                               | Fundamental to understanding the scope of Parliament's amending power under Article 368. Crucial for Polity, Governance, and Law. Questions frequently arise on what constitutes the basic structure and the limits of legislative power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India**       | 1978 | Expanded the scope of Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty) to include the right to travel abroad and the right to a dignified life. Established that any law depriving a person of life or liberty must be just, fair, and reasonable, not arbitrary. Introduced the "due process" concept in Indian constitutional law through interpretation of Article 21. | Significantly broadened the understanding and application of Fundamental Rights, particularly Article 21. Important for Polity, Governance, and Law, especially in relation to individual liberties, human rights, and procedural fairness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India**   | 1980 | Reaffirmed the doctrine of Basic Structure. Held that the power to amend the Constitution is not absolute and is subject to the basic structure doctrine. Further, it struck down certain amendments that sought to give precedence to Directive Principles of State Policy over Fundamental Rights, emphasizing the harmonious balance between the two. | Reinforces the supremacy of the Constitution over parliamentary enactments and the inviolability of the basic structure. Crucial for understanding the relationship between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles, and the limitations on amending power. Relevant for Polity, Governance, and Law.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India** | 1951 | Upheld the constitutional validity of the First Amendment Act, 1951, which introduced Article 31A and Article 31B, and the Ninth Schedule, effectively immunizing certain laws from judicial review. Held that the power of Parliament to amend Fundamental Rights under Article 368 was plenary. (Later revisited by Kesavananda Bharati). | An early case that defined the initial understanding of Parliament's amending powers. While its broad interpretation was later curtailed by the Basic Structure doctrine, understanding its historical context and initial reasoning is important for appreciating the evolution of constitutional law. Relevant for Polity, Governance, and Law.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Golak Nath v. State of Punjab**         | 1967 | Ruled that Fundamental Rights are transcendental, permanent, and cannot be abridged or taken away by Parliament through any amendment under Article 368. Parliament's power to amend the Constitution does not extend to abrogating or abridging Fundamental Rights. (This judgment was later overruled by the 24th Amendment Act and the Kesavananda Bharati case). | Historically significant as it represented a restrictive view on Parliament's amending power regarding Fundamental Rights before the establishment of the Basic Structure doctrine. Understanding this case helps in appreciating the judicial pronouncements that led to the Kesavananda Bharati judgment. Relevant for Polity, Governance, and Law.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain**      | 1975 | Applied the doctrine of Basic Structure to strike down the 39th Amendment Act, 1975, which had placed the election of the Prime Minister beyond judicial review. Affirmed that judicial review is a basic feature of the Constitution and cannot be abrogated. | A landmark case where the Basic Structure doctrine was directly applied to invalidate a constitutional amendment that attempted to curtail judicial review. Crucial for understanding the separation of powers and the role of the judiciary. Relevant for Polity, Governance, and Law.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **SR Bommai v. Union of India**          | 1994 | Laid down guidelines for the imposition of President's Rule under Article 356. Held that the President's power is not absolute and is subject to judicial review. Emphasized that secularism is a basic feature of the Constitution and that actions of state governments promoting religious disharmony are grounds for invoking Article 356. | Profoundly impacted the federal structure and the use of Article 356. Crucial for understanding the balance of power between the Centre and the States, and the constitutional limits on executive action. Highly relevant for Polity and Governance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan**        | 1997 | Laid down comprehensive guidelines for the prevention and redressal of sexual harassment of working women in workplaces, in the absence of specific legislation. These guidelines were based on international conventions and are considered law under Article 141. | A significant judgment in the area of women's rights and workplace safety. Established judicial activism in filling legislative gaps and upholding fundamental rights. Important for Social Justice, Governance, and Law.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
