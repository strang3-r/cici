*   **Direct Questions:** Expect direct questions on specific rights, their scope, and limitations.

### 💡 **Key Takeaways for UPSC** 💡

*   **Distinction:** Understand the difference between Fundamental Rights, Legal Rights, and Directive Principles of State Policy.

*   **Amendability:** While fundamental, they can be amended by Parliament through a special majority, but **not in a way that destroys their basic structure**. This is crucial for the **Basic Structure Doctrine**. 🏗️
*   **State Definition:** Know the definition of "State" under Article 12, as these rights are primarily against the State.
