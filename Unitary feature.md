The Unitary features of the Constitution of India are:

*   **Strong Central Government:** The Constitution establishes a strong central government with more powers compared to the state governments.
*   **Parliamentary Supremacy in Certain Matters:** Parliament has the power to alter the boundaries of states, create new states, or abolish existing ones.
*   **Single Constitution:** India has a single, unified constitution applicable to both the central and state governments.
*   **Single Citizenship:** Citizens of India have only one citizenship, that of India.
*   **Integrated Judiciary:** The Indian judiciary is integrated, with the Supreme Court at the apex, followed by high courts and subordinate courts. There is no separate judiciary for the states.
*   **All-India Services:** The Constitution provides for All-India Services (like IAS, IPS, IFS) which are recruited and controlled by the Union government, even though they serve the states.
*   **Appointment of Governors:** Governors of states are appointed by the President of India, acting on the advice of the Union government.
*   **Emergency Provisions:** The Constitution grants extensive powers to the Union government during emergencies (National Emergency, State Emergency, Financial Emergency), allowing it to assume greater control over states.
*   **Veto Power of the President:** The President of India has the power to withhold assent to state bills.
*   **Distribution of Powers:** While powers are divided between the Union and the States, the Union List contains the most important subjects, and Parliament has exclusive power to legislate on them. The Residuary powers also lie with the Union Parliament.
*   **Uniformity of Laws:** In certain areas, the Constitution aims for uniformity of laws across the country, such as marriage, divorce, bankruptcy, etc.
