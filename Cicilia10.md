## Comparison of Federal and Unitary Government Systems

| Feature                 | Federal Government                                                                                                                             | Unitary Government                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Distribution of Power** | Supreme power is constitutionally divided between a central national government and constituent political units (states, provinces).             | All governmental power is concentrated in a single, central authority.                                                                                                              |
| **Autonomy of Regions** | Constituent units have their own distinct spheres of authority and operate with a significant degree of constitutional autonomy.                | Regional or local bodies are created by and derive their powers solely from the central government; they act as agents of the central power and have no inherent constitutional autonomy. |
| **Source of Authority** | Both central and regional governments derive their powers directly from the constitution.                                                       | The central government is supreme; regional bodies' powers are delegated by the central government.                                                                                   |
| **Constitutional Basis**| A written constitution clearly delineates the powers of the central government and the constituent units. Amendments usually require consent from both. | The constitution typically vests all sovereign power in the central government.                                                                                                       |
| **Legislative Power**   | Both national and regional legislatures exist, each with its own defined legislative powers.                                                   | A single national legislature holds supreme legislative power.                                                                                                                      |
| **Judicial System**     | Often features a dual court system or a supreme court with the power to interpret the constitution and resolve disputes between levels of government. | Typically has a unified court system under the authority of the central government.                                                                                                   |
| **Uniformity of Laws**  | Laws and policies can vary significantly between different constituent units, reflecting regional diversity.                                    | Laws and policies tend to be uniform across the entire country, promoting national consistency.                                                                                       |
| **Responsiveness**      | Can be more responsive to the diverse needs and preferences of different regions due to regional autonomy.                                     | May be less responsive to local needs and concerns if the central government is distant or bureaucratic.                                                                              |
| **Decision-Making**     | Decision-making can be slower due to the need for consultation and coordination between different levels of government.                             | Decision-making can be quicker and more decisive as power is centralized.                                                                                                           |
